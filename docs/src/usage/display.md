# GUI

!!! info

    Sometimes we already have data in Julia and just want to see the results without exporting it to other software for visualization, which is too troublesome...ðŸ˜¢
    1) We assume that your device has at least one modern browser that supports WebGL 2.0
    2) Or you are using the official Julia extension in VSCode

This implementation is achieved through [WGLMakie.jl](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl/tree/master/WGLMakie), where users only need to provide the coordinates of the particles, and all other aspects are optional.

```@docs
vispts(
    coord   ::Matrix;
    colormap::Symbol=:viridis,
    colorby ::String="-1",
    attr    ::Vector=[-1],
    psize   ::Float32=1f-2,
    sample_n::Int=1000000
)
```

!!! warning

    If you are connecting to a remote headless server via SSH, you may encounter issues.
