# Get Started

With this package, we can convert the MPM simulation results (HDF5 files from ***[MaterialPointSolver.jl](https://github.com/LandslideSIM/MaterialPointSolver.jl)*** ) into `.vtp` files or create ParaView-compatible animations. Additionally, it includes some post-processing functionalities.

## Installation

Just type `]` in Julia's  `REPL`:

```julia
julia> ]
(@1.11) Pkg> add MaterialPointVisualizer
```
